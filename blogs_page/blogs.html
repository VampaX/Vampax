        <h4 style="color:rgb(66,155,174);"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Licensing and Mobility</span><br></h4>
        <p><strong>AWS</strong>: If you are new to cloud Amazon offers you the option to buy new licence (bundled with EC2 or relational Database service<br>instances) or else you can use previously purchased licenses (BYOL) as a part of their partnership
            with Microsoft. It is a case where user can use Dedicated Hosts or Software Assurance to move their licenses to the cloud. Before migrating a Licence, user have to make sure that all Microsoft Server application products migrated to cloud
            Service provider via License <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/licensing/licensing-programs/software-assurance-license-mobility">Mobility</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/licensing/licensing-programs/software-assurance-license-mobility">through Software Assurance</a>            Program must be covered with active software Assurance. List of eligible products, which includes Exchange Server, SQL Server Enterprise Edition, and Share point server much have server applications in their list. AWS licensing details can
            be found <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/windows/faq/#licensing">here.</a><br><br><strong>Azure</strong>: Microsoft also lets you license mobility for qualifying application servers, but one should determine if their server fits the requirement
            for mobility without paying anything extra for new license. Windows Server itself is NOT eligible (eg, running on-premises Windows Server with SQL server). If you spin up a VM in the cloud running the same stack, you will pay for two Windows
            server licenses since that license is charged per usage and not eligible for mobility. However, a SQL license is eligible, so you can use that to run SQL server in the cloud.

        <h4 style="color:rgb(66,155,174);"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hybrid Cloud Support</span><br></h4>
        <p><strong>AWS</strong>: Snowball Edge is introduced by AWS which is a 100TB hard drive for sharing workloads between its cloud and clients’ data<br>centres. A hybrid element is also added as it partnered with VMware to its portfolio to allow its
            customers to burst into its cloud environments. However it is still on the way of developing its hybrid nature.<br><br><strong>Azure</strong>: Azure has strong support for hybrid cloud services with platforms such as Azure StorSimple, Hybrid
            SQL Server, and <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/azure-stack/">Azure Stack</a>, a new hybrid cloud platform product that allows you to bring nearly full public Azure functionality to your own on-premises data centres with
            same pay-as-you go pricing model.<br></p>
